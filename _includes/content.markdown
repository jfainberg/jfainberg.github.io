I am a PhD student within the [ILCC] and [CSTR] institutes of the [School of Informatics] at the [University of Edinburgh]. My supervisors are [Steve Renals] and [Peter Bell].

I am currently on an internship with [SONOS](http://www.sonos.com).

My main research interests include

- *speech recognition*: factorised adaptation of data in various acoustic and linguistic conditions;
- *computational auditory scene analysis*: sound source localisation and separation inspired by the human auditory system; and
- *music information retrieval*: inference from audio such as genres, instrument detection, etc., skills which are typically effortless to humans.

### Past

- MSc Artificial Intelligence, [University of Edinburgh], 2015
- BMus Music & Sound Recording (Tonmeister), [IoSR], [University of Surrey], 2014 
- Various modules: calculus, linear algebra, electromagnetism and introductory psychology, [University of Oslo], 2010

I have previously worked as a theatre consultant for [Charcoalblue], advising on all aspects of audiovisual and acoustics design; and as a software tester and mechanic for the stage technology company [Visual act].
