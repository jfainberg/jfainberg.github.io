## Chaos and fractals
There is a great book called *[Chaos and Fractals]* which gives a tour of chaos theory. Each chapter ends with an example written in BASIC. I thought it would be fun to port these to [Processing](https://www.processing.org). (I got the book after a brilliant Seinfeld episode)

Here's the first one: [quadratic iterator](/fractals/1)
