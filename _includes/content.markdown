I am a PhD student within the [ILCC] and [CSTR] institutes of the [School of Informatics] at the [University of Edinburgh]. My supervisors are [Steve Renals] and [Peter Bell].

In the summer of 2018 I was an intern with [Bloomberg]. Previously I completed an internship with [Sonos] under the supervision of [Daniele Giacobello], and I was part of team [Edina](https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize/teams/edina) in the [Amazon Alexa Prize](https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize). The data we collected is available as the [Self-dialogue Corpus](https://github.com/jfainberg/self_dialogue_corpus). I had a small role in the [CitySounds] project.

My main research interests include

- *automatic speech recognition*: acoustic model adaptation in various acoustic and linguistic conditions;
- *computational auditory scene analysis*: sound source localisation and separation inspired by the human auditory system; and
- *music information retrieval*: inference from audio such as genres, instrument detection, etc., skills which are typically effortless to humans.

### Past

- MSc Artificial Intelligence, [University of Edinburgh], 2015
- BMus Music & Sound Recording (Tonmeister), [IoSR], [University of Surrey], 2014 
- Various modules: calculus, linear algebra, electromagnetism and introductory psychology, [University of Oslo], 2010

I have worked as a theatre consultant for [Charcoalblue], advising on all aspects of audiovisual and acoustics design; and as a software tester and mechanic for the stage technology company [Visual act].
